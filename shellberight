            <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
            <p>She'll Be Right was created to provide comprehensive support for individuals and families moving abroad or returning home. We understand the challenges that come with relocating, whether it's adjusting to a new culture, finding accommodation, or dealing with the emotional aspects of leaving a familiar environment. Our mission is to make these transitions as smooth and stress-free as possible.</p>

        <div id="how-we-started" class="section">
            <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p>Our journey began when a group of expatriates and repatriates shared their experiences and realized the common struggles they faced. We saw a need for a service that could provide practical advice, emotional support, and a sense of community. From those early conversations, She'll Be Right was born. Today, we are a dedicated team of professionals committed to helping others navigate the complexities of moving abroad or returning home.</p>
